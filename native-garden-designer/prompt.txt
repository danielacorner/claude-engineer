continue building a web app using r3f and ecosystem which allows the user to design a garden or landscape by placing plants along the ground in 3d space. The project has already been started using Vite+r3f and you can find the relevant files in ./native-garden-designer/src folder.

features:

- user can place plants on the ground
- user can adjust the ground height at each point on the ground
- plant height is different for each plant and sourced from a database (use local mock data for now)

TODOS:

- add a toolbar on bottom middle of the canvas that lets user toggle different menus, iconbuttons for each, such as but not limited to Add Plant, Edit Plant, etc.
- Add Plant iconbutton should open the PlantSelector drawer
- Edit Plant should close the PlantSelector drawer and change cursor to edit, and open the PlantEditor drawer when a plant is selected
- add a top left menu toolbar that lets user save or load designs, and also lets user toggle between different designs
- plant preview loads too slowly
