continue building a web app using r3f and ecosystem which allows the user to design a garden or landscape by placing plants along the ground in 3d space. The project has already been started using Vite+r3f and you can find the relevant files in ./native-garden-designer/src folder.

features:

- user can place plants on the ground
- user can adjust the ground height at each point on the ground
- plant height is different for each plant and sourced from a database (use local mock data for now)

TODOS:

- bug: when user places a plant it grows at the selected position but then moves instantly to the center column when it's finished growing instead of staying where the user clicked
- lots of state is found in App.tsx, which is causing unnecessary re-renders of subcomponents. Please move as much state as is reasonable into store.tsx global state store, and use that store to grab the state as low as possible in the component tree wherever that state is needed. Refer to PlantSelector.tsx to see how to grab state from the store.
- feature: each plant should have a "sizeMeters" param that scales the plant preview image by that number e.g. 2m = scale by 2x
- feature: an iconbutton with a compass icon whose compass needle spins as the user rotates the orbit, and which resets the camera and scene position / rotation when clicked
- bug: "something went wrong" appears below the canvas when placing a plant
- bug: when I select a plant to place e.g. click on "Oak Tree" then place an oak tree on the ground, the menu for selecting plants is no longer accessible -> expected: the "select a plant" menu should be accessible
- bug: plant preview images aren't showing up -> use a picsum.photos url to use a random photo related to the plant
