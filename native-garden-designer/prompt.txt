continue building a web app using r3f and ecosystem which allows the user to design a garden or landscape by placing plants along the ground in 3d space. The project has already been started using Vite+r3f and you can find the relevant files in ./native-garden-designer/src folder.

features:

- user can place plants on the ground
- user can adjust the ground height at each point on the ground
- plant height is different for each plant and sourced from a database (use local mock data for now)

TODOS:

- implement menu items in native-garden-designer\src\components\TopLeftMenu.tsx
  - you'll need to update native-garden-designer\store.tsx to accommodate related items in the global state
