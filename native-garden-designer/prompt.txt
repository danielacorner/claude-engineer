continue building a web app using r3f and ecosystem which allows the user to design a garden or landscape by placing plants along the ground in 3d space. The project has already been started using Vite+r3f and you can find the relevant files in ./native-garden-designer/src folder.

features:

- user can place plants on the ground
- user can adjust the ground height at each point on the ground
- plant height is different for each plant and sourced from a database (use local mock data for now)

TODOS:

- convert all animations to @react-spring instead of css transitions
- plant preview broken
