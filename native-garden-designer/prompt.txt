IMPORTANT: when returning code in responses, make sure you always include the full code and do not ever omit sections with e.g. " // ... (keep existing state and functions) " in your responses.

Your instructions:

Continue building the web app found in this folder "native-garden-designer", it's a web app using r3f and ecosystem which allows the user to design a garden or landscape by placing plants along the ground in 3d space. The project has already been started using Vite+r3f and you can find the relevant files in ./native-garden-designer/src folder.

App features:

- user can place plants on the ground
- user can adjust the ground height at each point on the ground
- plant height is different for each plant and sourced from a database (use local mock data for now)

TODOS:

- implement dragging on plants:
  - update src/store.tsx to accommodate required functionality if necessary
  - update src/components/PlantInstance.tsx and or src/components/PlantInstances.tsx to accommodate required functionality if necessary
  - user should be able to drag on any selected plant to move all selected plants at the same time
  - there is an existing drag implementation that is broken, please remove it if you see it
