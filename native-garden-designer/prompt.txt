Continue building the web app found in this folder "native-garden-designer", it's a web app using r3f and ecosystem which allows the user to design a garden or landscape by placing plants along the ground in 3d space. The project has already been started using Vite+r3f and you can find the relevant files in ./native-garden-designer/src folder.

features:

- user can place plants on the ground
- user can adjust the ground height at each point on the ground
- plant height is different for each plant and sourced from a database (use local mock data for now)

TODOS:

- implement menu items in native-garden-designer\src\components\TopLeftMenu.tsx
  - update native-garden-designer\store.tsx to accommodate required functionality
  - implement the following menu items:
    Edit:
    - Undo
    - Redo
    - Cut
    - Copy
    - Paste
    - Delete
  - at the same time, add standard keyboard shortcuts for each item, and add indicators to the menu items to show which keyboard shortcut maps to which menu item
